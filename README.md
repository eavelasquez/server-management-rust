# server-management-rust

This project shows the construction of a multi-threaded server, it is the result of Platzi's Server Management with Rust course and the [final project of the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html). It looks:

- A bit about TCP and HTTP.
- Listen for TCP connections on a socket.
- Parse a small number of HTTP requests.
- Create a proper HTTP response.
- Improve the throughput of our server with a thread pool.
